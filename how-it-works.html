            <h2>Understanding the Simulation Test</h2>
            <p>The simulation test uses a conceptual framework to determine the likelihood that we are in a simulated reality. This approach is based on logical reasoning rather than real-world data.</p>
            
            <h3>Conceptual Basis of Simulation Theory</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technological Feasibility:</strong> Advanced civilizations might create simulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Indistinguishability:</strong> Simulations could be so detailed that they are indistinguishable from reality.</li>
                <li><strong>Prevalence of Simulations:</strong> The number of simulations could far exceed the number of base realities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Simulation Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>The simulation hypothesis, popularized by philosopher Nick Bostrom, suggests that if advanced civilizations create simulations, the number of simulated realities might vastly outnumber base realities. Thus, the probability of us being in a simulation might be high.</p>
            <p>Bostrom's argument is based on three key ideas: the potential technological capability to create simulations, the indistinguishability of simulations from reality, and the prevalence of simulations relative to base realities.</p>

            <h3>Probability Formula</h3>
            <p>The probability (\(P_{\text{sim}}\)) that we are in a simulation is given by:</p>
            <p><strong>P<sub>sim</sub> = N<sub>sim</sub> / (N<sub>sim</sub> + N<sub>base</sub>)</strong></p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>N<sub>sim</sub>:</strong> Number of simulated realities.</li>
                <li><strong>N<sub>base</sub>:</strong> Number of base realities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Breakdown of the Equation</h3>
            <p>The equation calculates the probability of being in a simulation based on the ratio of simulated realities to the total number of realities (both simulated and base). If there are many more simulated realities compared to base realities, the probability that we are in a simulation increases.</p>
            <p>This theoretical approach provides a broad conceptual basis for understanding the simulation hypothesis, highlighting the implications of advanced simulation technologies and their potential impact on our perception of reality.</p>
